Spring Semester-2021 at IIT-B 
=============================

These are my notes for Spring-Semester 2021 at IIT-B.

I made notes of points which I thought were necessary, but I didn't recall by heart.

Apart from these, it has my own personal observations!

I started this with the intent to learn LaTeX, and stopped around the end of April as I thought that deed was done!

But then I again started from second half-sem seeing the utter need to do so in case of certain courses (like CS 152/154), where the lecture slides don't contain lot of information and most of the information is shared in the class itself.
