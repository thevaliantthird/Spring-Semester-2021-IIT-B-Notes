Spring Semester-2021 at IIT-B 
=============================

These are my notes for Spring-Semester 2021 at IIT-B.

For BB101 and MA106: These are supplementary to lectures, they contain only portions which professors discuss(doubts or otherwise!) but don't mention in slides.

For PH108, they have complete notes for the CDEEP Lectures, whereas only portions which the professors discuss(doubts or otherwise!) but don't mention in slides for rest of the Lectures/Tutorials 

and Complete Notes for CS 152/154

Apart from these it has my own personal observations!
